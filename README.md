![Breast Cancer Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Healthcare-ML-brightgreen)
![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accuracy-90%25-blue)

A web application that leverages machine learning to detect breast cancer by analyzing medical data inputs and classifying cases as either benign or malignant with high accuracy.

## üìã Project Overview

This system uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to train machine learning models that can distinguish between benign and malignant breast cancer cases. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for medical professionals to input patient data and receive instant predictions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves ~90% accuracy in cancer detection
- **Input Preprocessing**: Implements feature scaling for consistent model performance
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive web application for medical data input
- **Automated Testing**: Includes Selenium-based testing for application functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Clean CSS styling for various device sizes

## üß™ Dataset

The system is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass. Features include:

- Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness
- Compactness, concavity, concave points
- Symmetry, fractal dimension
- Mean, standard error, and "worst" values for each feature

The target variable is coded as:
- 0: Malignant
- 1: Benign

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, joblib for model persistence
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3
- **Testing**: Selenium WebDriver for automated testing


### Folder Explanations

- **model/**: Stores the trained machine learning model and scaler for preprocessing.
- **static/**: Contains static files like CSS for frontend styling.
- **templates/**: Holds HTML templates for rendering web pages.
- **utils/**: Utility scripts, such as data preprocessing functions.
- **testing/**: Automated test scripts (e.g., Selenium) for end-to-end testing.
- **app.py**: Main Flask application entry point.
- **breast_cancer_dataframe.csv**: The dataset used for model training and evaluation.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Divak-ar/Breast_Cancer.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd breast_cancer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py

## üíª Usage

1. Launch the web application using `python app.py`
2. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
3. Enter patient data in the provided input fields
4. Click the "Predict" button to receive cancer classification 
5. The system will display whether the sample is likely benign or malignant

## üîç Testing

Automated testing using Selenium WebDriver is included to ensure the application works as expected:

```bash
# Run automated tests
python testing/test_app.py
```

The test script automatically:
- Launches the web application
- Inputs test data into the form fields 
- Submits the form and validates the prediction response
- Provides test results in the console output
